# “If you close your eyes, you will not see the darkness.”

------

I breathed the last air that I love, then said goodbye. It seems like I had a dream. In the dream I crossed a thousand mile, then arrived at a place where was nobody there.

The place was lonely and deserted. I was alone, but also needed to be strong. It was snowing, and I was shed with cold tears in the dark snowy night. 

I still vaguely remember that I sat on a big hard meteorite. Around me it was  all dark, with no brightness. 

Aww... I covered my head painfully... Somethings in my brain seemed to be burning. At this time, I saw a horrible man with two two clusters of white flames in his eyes! He didn’t have any skin... Only the bones.

He was getting closer and closer to me. I tried to scream but I found I could not shout out anything. My body shook very hardly because of my extreme fearing. I kept watching that man, but he did not look like the monsters that I saw in the novels. He didn’t laugh strangely or did anything to sacre me further. He just walked silently with no expression. 

Finally, he was right in front of me. He raised his head and used his eyes that full of white flames to looked at me. He stared at me like a centuries’ long and suddenly I saw a sad expression on his face. He didn’t have any skin, but - I could feel it.

Then he started to talk to me. His voice is very warm and decreased my fearing to him. He spoke pure English. 

“Do not be scared of me, I have no malice for you. If you close your eyes, you will not see the darkness.”

I closed my eyes immediately. Now I couldn’t see anything, only his voice echoed in my brain

“I've been waiting here for a thousand years, now you are finally here.”

“I used to be a human, but something unfortunate happened to me, I lost my friends and my lover. My hatred destroyed my body and I was exiled here…...” His voice has become very light, he seems to recall the past time. He looked very lonely.

But I haven’t kept listening to him, I suppressed my fear and gently hugged him.

His body was really cold, just like ice. But I still tried my best to hugged him. I wanted him to felt a little bit warm at this cold world.

In the darkness,  two lonely people closely embraced.

He suddenly stopped talking, he seems like feeling the warm from me.

After a long while, he released me. He said thank you, then he disappeared.

I don’t know if it was a dream or not, does that world and that man exists or not?

But I learned that not everything ugly is evil, perhaps he owned the best soul in the world.

I still remember what he said. Nothing can make me afraid for the life.

“If you close your eyes, you will not see the darkness.”
